                        Loft is American "attic" style is impossible not to recognize at first glance. This is a special style that is clearly different from all the others.

                        The decoration of the walls is dominated by concrete, bare brickwork or imitation, rough plaster or light paint in gray or dusty shades of pastel colors. As a floor covering, the same concrete, tile, plank floor or laminate imitating it is used. The ceiling can also be concrete or whitewashed, possibly with unpainted wooden beams.

                        The loft style does not involve hiding water or ventilation pipes. They fit seamlessly into the interior. Corrugations with electrical wiring are also not hidden, but go straight along the walls.

                                When choosing furniture, the imagination has a place to roam. Everything is possible in the loft style. Cutting-edge furniture and high technology? Where is it without this! Old or artificially aged furniture that looks vintage? You're welcome! Furniture that looks like it was picked up in a landfill? You can do it, too. And most importantly, you can mix it all in one room.

                                 Welcome furniture made of metal, solid wood, plastic and glass. The upholstery is preferably made of leather or thick coarse fabric. If there are two or three expensive and spectacular things in the room, then the simplicity of the rest of the interior will set them off favorably. This is the peculiar elegance of the loft style.

                    <p>
                        Light in the loft interior is given a decisive importance. To make the room look truly authentic, lighting devices are chosen especially carefully.
                        Lighting is always complex, multi-level. A large space cannot be qualitatively illuminated with a single lamp, so several differently illuminated functional zones are combined. Each zone is illuminated quite brightly, the space between them is filled with diffused light.
